ConeZ CLI Command Reference
============================

The CLI is available simultaneously on both USB Serial and Telnet (port
23). All output goes to both streams; input is accepted from either.
Up to 3 simultaneous Telnet sessions are supported. The Telnet server
negotiates IAC WILL ECHO + WILL SGA so clients operate in character mode
with server-side echo. New Telnet connections receive the current prompt
and any partially-typed input immediately. Ctrl+D disconnects the
individual Telnet session.

The desktop simulator (see simulator.txt) supports a subset of these
commands in its console: ?/help, run, stop, open, dir/ls, del, cat/list,
ren/mv, cp, mkdir, rmdir, grep, hexdump, df, clear/cls, param, led,
sensors, time/date, uptime, ver/version, wasm, cue, mqtt, inflate/gunzip.
Hardware-only commands are not available in the simulator.

Line editing: arrow keys, Home/End, Delete, Ctrl-A/E, Ctrl-U (clear).
Up/Down arrows navigate command history (32 entries on PSRAM boards,
1 entry on Heltec). Duplicate consecutive commands are suppressed.
File paths are auto-normalized (/ prepended if missing).

Quoting: arguments with spaces must be enclosed in double quotes.
  - "Hello World"     → single argument: Hello World
  - "Quote \"Mess\""  → single argument: Quote "Mess"
  - Quote\"Mess\"     → single argument: Quote"Mess" (backslash-quote outside quotes)
  - \\                → single backslash (inside or outside quotes)
  Examples:
    wifi ssid "My Network"
    config set wifi.ssid "My Network"
    mqtt pub test/topic "Hello World"

Integer arguments: all integer arguments accept decimal, 0x hex, and
  0 octal prefixes. Examples:
    config set lora.sync_word 0x1424
    lora power 10
    gpio set 0x0A 1

Tab completion: pressing Tab auto-completes the current word.
  - First word: completes command names (case-insensitive).
  - After a command that takes file arguments: completes filenames from
    LittleFS. A leading / is auto-inserted if not typed. Directories
    get a trailing /. Paths with subdirectories work (e.g. run /scripts/h<TAB>).
  - File filtering: commands only show relevant files. For example,
    compile shows *.bas and *.c, run/load shows *.bas/*.c/*.wasm,
    inflate/gunzip shows *.gz, dir/ls/rmdir shows only directories.
  - After a command that has subcommands: completes from the registered
    subcommand list. Many commands then complete deeper argument positions
    with type-specific hints or further subcommand lists.
  - Multi-level completion examples:
      debug gps <TAB>              → on  off
      config set <TAB>             → wifi.  gps.  lora.  system.  ...

      config set wifi.ssid <TAB>   → <string>
      config set wifi.enabled <TAB> → on  off
      config set lora.frequency <TAB> → <float>
      config set led.count1 <TAB>  → <int>
      config set led.color1 <TAB>  → <hex>

      free <TAB>                   → <cr>
  - Indicators:
      <cr>      command is complete, press Enter (shown alone)
      [cr]      command is complete but subcommands also available (in list)
      <val>     a typed-in value is expected (not completed)
      <string>  a string value is expected
      <int>     an integer value is expected
      <float>   a float value is expected
      <hex>     a hex value is expected
  - Single match: completes in-place with trailing space (or / for dirs).
  - Multiple matches with common prefix: inserts the common prefix, then
    lists all matches.
  - Multiple matches without common prefix: lists all matches immediately.
  - No match: nothing happens.

Detailed Command Descriptions
-----------------------------

?
  Alias for the help display. Shows all available commands.

art
  Display an ANSI art traffic cone. Uses 256-color escapes.
  Requires ANSI mode (color on).

cat {filename}
  Print the contents of a file to the console. Alias: list.
  Example: cat /startup.bas

clear / cls
  Clear the terminal screen. Requires ANSI mode (color on).

color [on|off]
  Show or toggle ANSI color/escape code output. Default is on.

  color
      Show current state (on or off).

  color on
      Enable ANSI escape codes. Colored timestamps, source tags,
      and prompt are restored.

  color off
      Disable all ANSI escape codes. Output is plain text only.
      Commands that require ANSI (art, clear, game, winamp) will
      print an error. The editor falls back to a line-based mode.

compile {file.bas|file.c} [run]
  Compile a BASIC or C source file to a WASM binary on-device.
  Uses the embedded bas2wasm compiler for .bas files and the
  embedded c2wasm compiler for .c files. The output file has the
  same name with a .wasm extension (e.g. /test.c → /test.wasm).
  Optionally pass "run" to auto-run the compiled WASM immediately.
  Requires INCLUDE_BASIC_COMPILER (.bas) or INCLUDE_C_COMPILER (.c).
  Examples: compile /test.bas
            compile /test.bas run
            compile /demo.c
            compile /demo.c run

copy {src} {dst}
cp {src} {dst}
  Copy a file on LittleFS.
  Example: cp /startup.bas /startup_backup.bas

config
  Show all current configuration settings. See documentation/config.txt
  for the full config system reference.

  config set section.key value
      Set a configuration value and save to flash.
      Debug settings take effect immediately; all others require reboot.
      Values with spaces must be quoted (e.g. config set wifi.ssid "My Net").
      Integer values accept 0x hex prefix (e.g. config set lora.sync_word 0x1424).

  config unset section.key
      Revert a single key to its compiled default and save.

  config reset
      Delete /config.ini and revert all settings to compiled defaults.

cue
  Control the cue timeline engine for synchronized LED shows.

  cue load {filename}
      Load a binary .cue file from LittleFS.
      Example: cue load /show.cue

  cue start [ms]
      Start cue playback. With no argument, starts from now. With an
      offset in ms, treats playback as having started that many ms ago
      (useful for syncing to a track already in progress).

  cue stop
      Stop cue playback.

  cue status
      Show cue engine state: loaded file, playing/stopped, position.

debug
  With no arguments, shows the current on/off state of each debug source.

  debug off
      Turn off all debug message sources.

  debug {source}
      Turn on the named source. Equivalent to "debug {source} on".

  debug {source} on|off
      Enable or disable a specific source.

  Sources: SYSTEM, BASIC, WASM, COMMANDS, SHELL, GPS, GPS_RAW, LORA,
           LORA_RAW, FSYNC, WIFI, SENSORS, OTHER

  When MQTT is connected, enabled debug messages are also published to
  the MQTT topic conez/{cone_id}/debug (except SOURCE_MQTT, to prevent
  feedback loops). When COMMANDS is enabled, CLI commands and their
  output are logged with the "CMD" tag, including the prompt line
  (e.g. "> dir"). See documentation/mqtt.txt for payload format.

game
  Conway's Game of Life on a 30x20 toroidal grid with RGB age-based
  coloring. Runs at ~10 FPS. Press any key to exit.
  Requires ANSI mode (color on).

del {filename}
  Delete a file from LittleFS.
  Example: del /old_script.bas

df
  Show LittleFS filesystem usage: total, used, and free space.

dir [path]
  List all files and directories on LittleFS with sizes. Optionally
  specify a subdirectory to list only its contents. Alias: ls.
  Examples: dir
            dir /scripts

edit {filename}
  Open the text editor for on-device script editing. Creates the file
  if it doesn't exist. In ANSI mode, opens a full-screen nano-like
  editor with arrow key navigation, find/replace (Ctrl-F), goto line
  (Ctrl-G), cut/paste (Ctrl-K/U), save (Ctrl-W), and quit (Ctrl-X).

  Ctrl-F prompts for search text, then asks (F)ind or (R)eplace.
  Find jumps to the next match (wraps around). Replace walks matches
  with y/n/a/q confirmation (yes, no, all, quit). Pressing Ctrl-F
  again with empty input repeats the last search (find-next).

  When ANSI is off (color off), falls back to a line editor with
  numbered lines and commands: l(ist), N (show line), i(nsert) N,
  a(ppend), d(elete) N, r(eplace) N, p(rint) N M, f(ind) text,
  s(ubstitute) old new, w(rite), q(uit).
  Example: edit /startup.bas

gpio
  With no arguments, shows all GPIO pin states (direction and level).
  Only shows pins valid for the current board.

  gpio set <pin> <0|1>
      Set the output level of an already-configured output pin.

  gpio out <pin> <0|1>
      Configure pin as output and set its level.

  gpio in <pin> [up|down|none]
      Configure pin as input with optional pull-up/pull-down.
      Default is no pull if not specified.

  gpio read <pin>
      Read the digital level of a single pin.

grep {pattern} [file]
  Case-insensitive substring search in file contents. With a filename,
  searches that file and shows matching lines with line numbers. Without
  a filename, searches all files on LittleFS recursively and prefixes
  matches with the file path.
  Examples: grep PRINT /test.bas
            grep TODO

gps
  With no arguments, shows GPS status: fix type, satellites, HDOP/VDOP/
  PDOP, position, altitude, speed, direction, local time with timezone,
  PPS info. Only available on boards with GPS hardware.

  gps info
      Query GPS module firmware version and hardware model.
      Enable 'debug gps_raw' to see the module's response.

  gps set baud <rate>
      Set the GPS module's serial baud rate.
      Valid rates: 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200.
      Note: the firmware always connects at 9600 on boot.

  gps set rate <hz>
      Set the GPS position update rate.
      Valid rates: 1, 2, 4, 5, or 10 Hz.

  gps set mode <constellation>
      Set which satellite constellations to use.
      Options: gps, bds, glonass, gps+bds, gps+glonass, bds+glonass, all

  gps set nmea <sentences>
      Enable specific NMEA sentence types at 1/fix rate, disable others.
      Comma-separated list of: gga, gll, gsa, gsv, rmc, vtg, zda, ant,
      dhv, lps, utc, gst, tim.
      Example: gps set nmea gga,rmc,gsa

  gps save
      Save the current GPS module configuration to its internal flash.
      Without this, settings revert on GPS module power cycle.

  gps restart <type>
      Restart the GPS module.
      Types: hot (keep ephemeris), warm (keep almanac), cold (clear all),
      factory (reset to factory defaults).

  gps send <body>
      Send an arbitrary NMEA sentence to the GPS module. The checksum
      is computed and appended automatically. The body is everything
      between $ and * (exclusive).
      Example: gps send PCAS06,0

help
  Show all available commands. Same as ?.

hexdump {filename} [count]
  Show a hex+ASCII dump of a file. Default shows first 256 bytes.
  Optionally specify byte count.
  Examples: hexdump /test.wasm
            hexdump /data.bin 1024

history
  Show command history. On PSRAM boards, stores up to 32 commands in a
  ring buffer. On boards without PSRAM, stores only the most recent
  command. Up/Down arrows navigate history.

inflate {input} [output]
  Decompress a gzip, zlib, or raw deflate file. Auto-detects format from
  file header. Output defaults to the input filename with .gz/.z stripped,
  or input.out if no recognized extension. Alias: gunzip.
  Streaming decompression — peak RAM is the compressed file size plus
  ~43KB (32KB dictionary + ~11KB decompressor state).
  Examples: inflate /data.gz
            inflate /archive.gz /output.bin
            gunzip /data.gz

deflate {input} [output] [level]
  Compress a file to gzip format. Output defaults to input.gz.
  Level 1-9 (1=fastest, 9=best, default 6). Alias: gzip.
  Uses PSRAM for dictionary and hash tables when available.
  Examples: deflate /data.txt
            deflate /data.txt /data.gz 9
            gzip /data.txt

led
  Show LED strip configuration and current RGB values per LED.
  Each channel header includes a visual color bar using ANSI 24-bit
  RGB block characters (when ANSI mode is on). Color escapes are
  deduplicated — only emitted when the color changes from the
  previous LED. Below the bar, values are listed as #RRGGBB, 8 per
  line with starting index. Only available on boards with RGB LEDs.

  led set <ch> <index|start-end|all> <#RRGGBB>
      Set one or more LEDs on a channel to the given color.
      Examples:
        led set 1 0 #FF0000        Set channel 1 LED 0 to red
        led set 2 0-9 #00FF00      Set channel 2 LEDs 0-9 to green
        led set 3 all #0000FF      Set all channel 3 LEDs to blue

  led count <ch> <n>
      Resize channel ch to n LEDs (0 to disable). Existing colors
      are preserved; any new LEDs are set to black. Hot-applied
      immediately. Not saved to flash; use "config set led.countN
      <n>" to persist.
      Examples: led count 1 100
                led count 2 0

  led clear
      Set all LEDs on all channels to black (#000000).

log
  Show recent debug messages from the PSRAM ring buffer (128 entries on
  ConeZ PCB, 16 on Heltec). The ring buffer always captures tagged debug
  messages (same payload as MQTT debug: timestamp + source tag + message,
  ANSI stripped). No configuration needed — the buffer is allocated at
  boot and fills silently. If PSRAM allocation fails, the buffer is
  unavailable and "log" reports empty.

  log to <path>
      Open a file on LittleFS and start appending debug messages to it.
      Each message is written as a line with timestamp, tag, and text.
      The file is opened in append mode. Only one log file can be open
      at a time; opening a new one closes the previous.
      Example: log to /debug.txt

  log save <path>
      Save the current ring buffer contents to a file and close it.
      Unlike "log to", this is a one-shot dump — the file is not kept
      open for ongoing logging.
      Example: log save /snapshot.txt

  log close
  log stop
      Close the open log file (from "log to").

  Unlike the MQTT debug sink (which excludes SOURCE_MQTT to prevent
  feedback loops), the ring buffer and file sinks include SOURCE_MQTT
  messages — useful for debugging MQTT itself.

list {filename}
  Alias for cat. Print the contents of a file to the console.
  Example: list /startup.bas

load {filename}
  Receive a file over the serial connection line by line.
  Send CTRL+Z (0x1A) to end transmission and save the file.
  Example: load /new_script.bas

lora (alias: radio)
  Show LoRa radio status. Display is mode-aware: in LoRa mode shows
  frequency, bandwidth, spreading factor, coding rate, preamble, sync
  word. In FSK mode shows frequency, bit rate, frequency deviation,
  RX bandwidth, preamble, shaping, whitening, sync word, CRC. Both
  modes show TX power, last RSSI and SNR.

  lora freq <MHz>
      Set the radio frequency in MHz. Hot-applied immediately.
      Example: lora freq 433.0

  lora power <dBm>
      Set TX output power in dBm. Hot-applied immediately.
      Example: lora power 10

  lora bw <kHz>
      Set bandwidth in kHz. LoRa mode only. Hot-applied immediately.
      Example: lora bw 250

  lora sf <7-12>
      Set spreading factor. LoRa mode only. Hot-applied immediately.
      Example: lora sf 12

  lora cr <5-8>
      Set coding rate (denominator of 4/N). LoRa mode only.
      Hot-applied immediately.
      Example: lora cr 8

  lora mode <lora|fsk>
      Switch between LoRa and FSK modes. Performs a full radio
      re-initialization using current config values.
      Example: lora mode fsk

  All subcommands update the in-memory config but do NOT save to flash.
  Use "config set lora.*" to persist changes across reboots.

mem
  Show heap memory: free bytes, minimum since boot, largest allocatable
  block. Also shows PSRAM summary if available.

mqtt
  Show MQTT client status: enabled, broker, state, uptime, TX/RX counts.

  mqtt enable
      Enable the MQTT client (starts auto-connect).

  mqtt disable
      Disable the MQTT client and disconnect.

  mqtt connect
      Force an immediate connection attempt (also enables).

  mqtt disconnect
      Disconnect from the broker (will auto-reconnect unless disabled).

  mqtt broker <hostname>
      Set the MQTT broker hostname or IP. Hot-applied immediately
      (disconnects and reconnects to the new broker).
      Example: mqtt broker 192.168.1.100

  mqtt port <number>
      Set the MQTT broker port. Hot-applied (disconnects and reconnects).
      Example: mqtt port 1884

  mqtt pub <topic> <payload>
      Publish a message to a topic (for testing). Use quotes for payloads
      with spaces.
      Examples: mqtt pub test/hello world
                mqtt pub test/hello "Hello World"

  Use "config set mqtt.broker <host>", "config set mqtt.port <num>",
  or "config set mqtt.enabled on" to persist across reboots.

mkdir {path}
  Create a directory on LittleFS.
  Example: mkdir /scripts

move {oldname} {newname}
mv {oldname} {newname}
  Alias for ren. Rename or move a file on LittleFS.
  Example: mv /old.bas /new.bas

param {id} {value}
  Set a script parameter. Parameters are a 16-slot integer array shared
  between the main loop and running scripts (BASIC or WASM). BASIC reads
  them with GETPARAM(id); WASM reads them with get_param(id).
  Example: param 1 42

ps
  Show FreeRTOS task list with state, priority, core affinity, and
  minimum free stack (high water mark) for each known task.

psram
  With no arguments, shows PSRAM status: availability, SPI clock speed,
  total/used/free/contiguous bytes, allocation slot usage, and cache
  hit rate. Available on all boards (shows "not available" on boards
  without PSRAM hardware).

  The default output includes a 64-character allocation map where each
  character represents 128KB of PSRAM: - (free), + (partially used),
  * (fully allocated). Also shows a cache page map: - (empty), C
  (clean), D (dirty). Both maps are ANSI colored when available.

  psram cache
      Show detailed cache page metadata: per-page PSRAM address, dirty
      status, LRU age, plus overall hit/miss stats and occupancy.

  psram test
      Run a full PSRAM memory test with read/write verification and
      throughput benchmark. Temporarily frees the shell history ring
      buffer to get exclusive PSRAM access, then re-allocates it after.

  psram test forever
      Run the memory test in a loop until an error occurs or a key is
      pressed. Useful for burn-in testing.

  psram freq <MHz>
      Change the SPI clock frequency at runtime (5-80 MHz). Useful for
      benchmarking. Default is 40 MHz. Only available on boards with
      external SPI PSRAM (ConeZ PCB).

reboot
  Reboot the ESP32.

ren {oldname} {newname}
  Rename a file on LittleFS.
  Example: ren /old.bas /new.bas

rmdir {path}
  Remove an empty directory from LittleFS.
  Example: rmdir /scripts

run {filename}
  Run a script file. The file extension determines the runtime: .bas
  files run on the BASIC interpreter task, .wasm files run on the WASM
  interpreter task. Both tasks are unpinned (tskNO_AFFINITY) and run on
  whichever core has bandwidth. Only one script of each type can run at
  a time.
  Examples: run /test.bas
            run /rgb_cycle.wasm

sensors
  Show sensor readings: IMU (roll/pitch/yaw/acceleration), temperature,
  battery voltage, solar voltage. Available sensors depend on the board.

status
  Show a compact one-screen system overview. Each subsystem gets one line:
  firmware version and uptime, cone identity (id/group), WiFi, MQTT, LoRa,
  GPS (boards with GPS only), time, script (WASM), cue engine, heap, PSRAM,
  LEDs (boards with RGB LEDs), and sensors. Inactive or unavailable
  subsystems show a short status (e.g. "Disabled", "idle", "not available").

stop
  Stop the currently running script. Sets parameter 0 to 1 (checked by
  BASIC via GETPARAM(0)) and signals the WASM runtime to exit. WASM
  modules are also stopped automatically via the m3_Yield() hook.

tc
  Show the thread loop counter for each CPU core. Useful for checking
  that tasks are running.

time / date
  Show current local date, time, day of week, timezone, time source
  (GPS+PPS, NTP, or compile-time), and epoch milliseconds. Time is
  displayed in the local timezone (config system.timezone + auto DST).
  Available on all boards — GPS boards use PPS-disciplined time,
  others fall back to NTP when WiFi is connected. NTP auto-initializes
  whenever WiFi connects (including via CLI commands) and re-syncs
  periodically (config system.ntp_interval, default 3600s). If neither
  GPS nor NTP is available, time starts from the firmware's compile
  timestamp.

uptime
  Show time since boot in days, hours, minutes, seconds.

ver
  Alias for version.

version
  Show firmware project name, version, build date/time, board type,
  embedded compiler versions (bas2wasm, c2wasm), and firmware versions
  in all OTA partitions (label, address, size, running/boot status).

wasm
  Show WASM runtime status and module information.

  wasm status
      Show whether a WASM module is running and its file path.

  wasm info {filename}
      Show the size of a .wasm file on LittleFS.
      Example: wasm info /rgb_cycle.wasm

wifi
  Show WiFi status: enabled, configured SSID, connection state, connected
  SSID, BSSID, channel, RSSI, IP/gateway/subnet/DNS, hostname, MAC, TX
  power.

  wifi enable
      Enable WiFi and connect using the configured SSID/password.

  wifi disable
      Disable WiFi and turn off the radio.

  wifi ssid <name>
      Set the WiFi SSID and reconnect immediately. Use quotes for SSIDs
      with spaces: wifi ssid "My Network". Not saved to flash; use
      "config set wifi.ssid <name>" to persist across reboots.

  wifi password <psk>
  wifi pass <psk>
  wifi psk <psk>
      Set the WiFi password and reconnect immediately. Not saved to
      flash; use "config set wifi.password <psk>" to persist.

  Use "config set wifi.enabled on|off" to persist the enabled state
  across reboots. WiFi is enabled by default.

winamp
  Audio visualizer LED effect. Displays a retro-style equalizer on
  LED strips. Press any key to exit. Requires ANSI mode (color on).
