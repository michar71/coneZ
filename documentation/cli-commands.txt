ConeZ CLI Command Reference
============================

The CLI is available via Telnet (default) or USB Serial. After boot the
CLI listens on Telnet; pressing any key on the USB Serial port switches
the CLI back to Serial.

Detailed Command Descriptions
-----------------------------

?
  Alias for the help display. Shows all available commands.

config
  Show all current configuration settings. See documentation/config.txt
  for the full config system reference.

  config set section.key value
      Set a configuration value and save to flash.
      Debug settings take effect immediately; all others require reboot.
      Values with spaces are supported (e.g. config set wifi.ssid My Net).

  config unset section.key
      Revert a single key to its compiled default and save.

  config reset
      Delete /config.ini and revert all settings to compiled defaults.

debug
  With no arguments, shows the current on/off state of each debug source.

  debug off
      Turn off all debug message sources.

  debug {source}
      Turn on the named source. Equivalent to "debug {source} on".

  debug {source} on|off
      Enable or disable a specific source.

  Sources: SYSTEM, BASIC, COMMANDS, SHELL, GPS, GPS_RAW, LORA, LORA_RAW,
           FSYNC, WIFI, SENSORS, OTHER

del {filename}
  Delete a file from LittleFS. Path must start with /.
  Example: del /old_script.bas

dir
  List all files and directories on LittleFS with sizes.

gps
  Show GPS status: fix, satellites, HDOP, position, altitude, speed,
  direction. Only available on boards with GPS hardware.

led
  Show LED strip configuration (number of LEDs per strip).
  Only available on boards with RGB LEDs.

list {filename}
  Print the contents of a file to the console.
  Example: list /startup.bas

load {filename}
  Receive a file over the serial connection line by line.
  Send CTRL+Z (0x1A) to end transmission and save the file.
  Example: load /new_script.bas

lora
  Show LoRa radio status: frequency, bandwidth, spreading factor,
  last RSSI and SNR.

mem
  Show heap memory: free bytes, minimum since boot, largest allocatable
  block.

param {id} {value}
  Set a BASIC program parameter. Parameters are a 16-slot integer array
  shared between the main loop and running BASIC scripts. The BASIC
  program reads them with GETPARAM(id).
  Example: param 1 42

ps
  Show FreeRTOS task list with state, priority, core affinity, and
  minimum free stack (high water mark) for each known task.

reboot
  Reboot the ESP32.

ren {oldname} {newname}
  Rename a file on LittleFS.
  Example: ren /old.bas /new.bas

run {filename}
  Start a BASIC program. The program runs on the dedicated BASIC task
  (Core 0). Only one program can run at a time.
  Example: run /test.bas

sensors
  Show sensor readings: IMU (roll/pitch/yaw/acceleration), temperature,
  battery voltage, solar voltage. Available sensors depend on the board.

stop
  Stop the currently running BASIC program by setting parameter 0 to 1.
  The BASIC program should check GETPARAM(0) to honor the stop request.

tc
  Show the thread loop counter for each CPU core. Useful for checking
  that tasks are running.

time
  Show current date, time, and day of week from GPS.
  Only available on boards with GPS hardware.

uptime
  Show time since boot in days, hours, minutes, seconds.

version
  Show firmware project name, version, build date/time, and board type.

wifi
  Show WiFi status: SSID, connection state, IP address, RSSI.
