Known Firmware Bugs
===================
Identified 2026-02-05 via code review. Organized by severity.


CRITICAL
--------

#3  FIXED -- Mutex released before interp(); next_code copied to local buffer

#7  FIXED -- Duplicate "debug" global variable removed from main.cpp

#8  FIXED -- GPS_RX_PIN was a typo (40 instead of 44). LED_PIN=40 is correct.


HIGH
----

#9  FIXED -- FastLED separated into dedicated render task (led.cpp/led.h).
    FastLED.show() now called from exactly one place: the LED render task
    on Core 1. All other code writes to LED buffers and calls led_show()
    to set a dirty flag. The render task runs at ~30 FPS.

#10 FIXED -- SOS_effect2() rewritten as non-blocking state machine.
    All delay() calls removed; uses millis()-based state machine
    (IDLE, WAIT_OFFSET, RAMP_UP, RAMP_DOWN) that returns to loop()
    each iteration. No new FreeRTOS task needed.

#11 FIXED -- Effects now use get_org_lat()/get_org_lon() instead of
    hardcoded origin coordinates. All three effects (SOS_effect, SOS_effect2,
    CIRCLE_effect) updated.

#12 FIXED -- SCALE_() returns input instead of scaled result

#13 FIXED -- TEMP/HUM function registration broken

#14 FIXED -- RGB<->HSV conversion functions are swapped

#15 FIXED -- ACCZ_() returns Y-axis instead of Z-axis

#16 FIXED -- EVENT_SYS_TIMER logic broken


MEDIUM
------

#18 FIXED -- SOURCE_SHELL debug flag corrected in printManager.cpp

#19 FIXED -- Added volatile to cross-core GPS/sensor/sun globals

#20 FIXED -- ROTATEARRAY_() left-rotate off-by-one corrected

#21 FIXED -- WAITFOR_() int8_t type mismatch corrected

#24 FIXED -- IMU_INT_PIN was a typo (37 instead of 41). RGB2_PIN=37 is correct.

#25 FIXED -- readFile() now reads line-by-line

#26 FIXED -- check_serial() only calls init_commands() once via flag

#27 FIXED -- Date/time functions now return -1 on error instead of 1

#28 FIXED -- DAY/MONTH/YEAR/GPSALT registered in funhook_(), GPSALT_T defined

#29 FIXED -- sunSetPosition() header signature matches implementation
