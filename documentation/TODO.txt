Hardware:
  Apply fixes to all v0.1 boards:
     Remove R11
     Bridge Rx/Tx to GPS
     Add LoRa antenna wire

  For next board revision:
     Add ESD protection to all external connections, playa is high-static environment.
     Remove R11, or make it pull GPS_ON high, or else connect GPS_ON to a GPIO pin
     Connect GPS RX/TX to UART, or other GPIOs that can be mapped to one of the UARTs?
     Board fails if solar input voltage exceeds 17VDC or 18VDC?  Needs to handle up to 20VDC solar input.
     Add jumper-selectable 3.3V vs 5V signal level on RGB LED signal outputs, WS2811 12V strings might need 5V TTL levels?
     Jumper-selectable LEDs, to disable them for other projects.
     Make the various LEDs different colors, rather than all yellow, to differentiate function by quick visual check?

Firmware:
   Base Code
      POST
      Temp Sensor Tie-In
      IMU Driver

   Basic
     Own Thread. (How do we handle debug messages? Dump into file?)
     Hook up Location Services
     Hook up Sync pulse
     Push RAM into PSRAM?
     Add Temp Sensor Support
